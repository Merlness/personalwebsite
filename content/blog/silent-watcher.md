# A Quiet Morning

It was barely dawn when I set out into the reserve. The air was crisp, and the dew was still heavy on the grass. I wasn't expecting to see much; usually, the animals are shy this close to the trail.

But then, movement.

Just a few yards away, a **fox** paused. It didn't run. It just stood there, watching me with an intensity that felt almost human.

I slowly raised my camera, holding my breath. *Click.*

That moment lasted only seconds, but the photo captured a lifetime of wild curiosity. It remains one of my favorite shots from the trip.
